# Forest-Fire-Prediction-IoT-Application
To predict the forest fire based on the sensor values.
To classify it based on the values of different parameters such as temperature, smoke,flame as mild,moderate, severe or No Forest Fire.
An application is designed to display the sensor readings and the result of the classification.
The proposed system will also use fuzzy logic rules to express the chance of occurence of the forest fire in percentage in the near future.
